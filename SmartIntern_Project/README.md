# Project Description

- In this project, a supervised machine learning model is built to predict tentative laptop price based on its specifications.
- This model is trained on dataset which is taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aggle6666/laptop-price-prediction-dataset).
- The dataset contains laptop specifications and corresponding prices.
- The description of this dataset is as following:

| Weight           | Weight of laptop in kg                                     |
| Price            | Laptop price in ( ‚Çπ ) Indian Rupee                         |

- Scikit-learn library is used to build the machine learning model.
- Streamlit is used to make a web application that allows users to select the laptop specifications and user gets tentative price of the laptop.
